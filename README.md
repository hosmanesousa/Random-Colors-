** Version 1.0.0 **

Rules of the Game

Objective: Try guessing the right color 

Easy mode

3 display colors, try to guess the color randomly selected by the array of colors

Hard mode

When you guess the correct colors, all remaning colors will adopt that right colors.

# Possible improvements

** Restrict the number of guesses 

Easy mode: 1 guess to get the right color

Hard mode: 3 guesses to get the right color


** Variables

Declaring variables with let keyword is okay, but declaring them with const instead would have been more appropriate in some cases.
